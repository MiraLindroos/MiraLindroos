# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio

I'm a graduate in **Business Information Systems** from **TAMK (Tampere University of Applied Sciences)**.  
This repository showcases selected projects I've built during my studies and free time.  

**Currently**, I’m working on backend development for an AI-generated frontend.  
In this project, I’m learning and using **Supabase** together with **TypeScript**, focusing on:  
**-Supabase Database**  
**-Supabase Auth**  
**-Supabase Edge Functions** 

🔥During summer 2025, I developed a time management web application with **React** and **Firebase**. A few **selected code snippets** are available in the pinned **Time-management-app repository**, giving a brief look into the app’s structure and implementation without exposing the full private codebase.   

I'm **looking for full-time opportunities** where I can apply my skills and continue growing as a software developer.  

### 📄 Thesis  
I developed a **digital signature solution** for employee contract management using **Node.js**, integrated with the **Signicat Authentication API**. The backend was deployed via **Firebase Cloud Functions**, and the frontend was built using **React Native** and **Vue.js**. This project strengthened my skills in **API integrations**, **secure data processing**, and **cloud-based backend development**.
