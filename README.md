# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio

I'm a graduate in **Business Information Systems** from **TAMK (Tampere University of Applied Sciences)**.  
This repository showcases some of the projects I've built during my studies and free time.  
🔥Currently I am developing a time management web application with React and Firebase.  


I'm **looking for full-time opportunities**, where I can apply my existing knowledge while learning new technologies! 

### 📄 Thesis  
I developed a **digital signature solution** for employee contract management using **Node.js**, integrated with the **Signicat Authentication API**. The backend was deployed via **Firebase Cloud Functions**, and the frontend was built using **React Native** and **Vue.js**. This project gave me practical experience with backend logic, cloud services, and real-world system integration.
